# Poeltl Unlimited
## Description
A remake of the Poeltl game using Python to allow for unlimited plays per day.

## What is Poeltl?
Poeltl is a game based on Wordle made for the NBA. Instead of guessing words like Wordle, Poeltl has players guess current NBA players. It will tell the player if they are close using the criteria in the "Hints" section. The player is allowed 8 guesses to guess the NBA player correct.

## Hints
Name: Green = Correct, White = Wrong\
Team: Green = Current Team, Yellow = Previous Team, White = Never played for the team\
Conference (CONF): Green = Correct, White = Wrong\
Division (DIV): Green = Correct, White = Wrong\
Position (POS): Green = Correct, Yellow = Partially Correct, White = Wrong\
Height (HT): Green = Correct, Yellow = Within 2 Inches, White = Wrong by more than 2 inches\
Age: Green = Correct, Yellow = Within 2 Years, White = Wrong by more than 2 years\
Jersey Number (#): Green = Correct, Yellow = Within 2 Numbers, White = Wrong by more than 2 numbers\
